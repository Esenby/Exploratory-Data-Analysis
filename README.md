# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Course June 2015

After extracting data for the two dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02, and creating a time line from the Year and Time
columns in the extracted data frame, as a new column "datetime", the base plotting of R was used to follow the 
instructions of the assignment.

The 4 figures plot1.png ... plot4.png are created with the programmes plot1.r ... plot4.r respectively.

The recommended process for printing to the png files is followed for plot1.png, plot2.png and plot3.png
but I had to resort to dev.copy for plot4.png, although the screen (windows) plot produced all four together on
the one graph (and was therefore used to print the file plot4.png)
